# Features

* Auto Import undefined identifiers from installed dependencies and source code
* Support ES module import and Flow import
* Sort imports

# Usage

TBD

# Know issues

* VS Code only allow one `Format Document` extension for Javascript, so if you are using extensions have the same feature (i.e: Prettier), these extensions need to be disabled.

# Credit

This extension inspired by Prettier extension. A lot of code is copied from that.

# TODO

* Support alias config in autoimport.json (import {A as B} from "C")
